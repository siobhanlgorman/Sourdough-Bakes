            <h3>About Us</h3>

            <p>We are an small artisan bakery based in Ennis, County Clare, specialising in sourdough breads and
                bakes.
                After baking for family and friends from home for years we decided to open up a
                small business to bring our bread to a wider community.
                Here at the sourdough bakehouse we are passionate about baking with sourdough. Everything we bake
                here
                is made using sourdough leaven, both savoury and sweet. Sourdough doesn't just taste fantastic, but it's much
                healthier too. This is real baking with no artificial additives or raising agents. We use only organic flour and grains. We have kept our range to
                our
                six tried and tested favourite loaves.
            </p>

            <h3>What is it?</h3>

            <p>Sourdough is the process of using the yeast which is naturally present in flour to rise bread. This
                is
                the centuries old method of making bread before the rise of the mass-produced bread ubiquitous
                today.
                Sourdough bread needs only three ingredients: flour, water and salt so it is as ‘natural’ as bread
                can
                be.
            </p>
            <h3>Why is it so special?</h3>
            <p> To rise a sourdough takes a much longer time than using commercially produced yeast. Given
                enough
                time and warmth the yeast and the (good) bacteria in flour work together to break down the
                grains in
                the flour and produce the carbon-dioxide to rise the bread. This results in a bread which is
                much
                more flavoursome and digestible as our bodies don’t have to work so hard to digest the grains.
                Many
                people who consider themselves intolerant to wheat gluten find they are better able to tolerate
                sourdough bread. What’s more sourdough bread lasts longer too as it has a less crumbly structure
                and
                retains its moisture. Making sourdough bread requires time and patience as it is dependent on
                variables such as temperature and how active it is. It can be moody! A loaf can take anything
                between 12 hours to several days from start to finish. As a general rule a longer rise at a
                cooler
                temperature results in a more flavoursome bread.
