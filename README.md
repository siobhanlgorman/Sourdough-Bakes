## Fonts

Body Lora, sans serif
Headings and logo Poppins sans serif

## Colours
    
* The colour theme is based around the colour of the business logo which is color: #5b8030; dark green. The other green shades on the site and the 
are chosen to  and to conjure up the ehtos of the business which is natural, organic, healthy food - so green shades I kept the background neutral white to keep contrast high and the charcoal text font colour is less harsh to the users' eyes than black.

underline to show active page on menu grey #3a3a3a
    headings colour #252525 less harsh than black, also used for text on cover of hero image as #3a3a3a was a little too faint.
