# Introduction

This is a website for a fictional new bakery in Ennis, Co. Clare which specialises in baked goods made with sourdough leaven, using organic ingredients with no artificial additives. There are two ranges available bread and sweet bakes. The purpose of the website is to establish an online presence for the bakery to help increase the customer base.

As the website and business owner I want to
  * create an online presence for our business
  * grow our local customer base
  * inform existing and new customers about our produce, location, opening hours
  * to provide a method of contact for customers to order produce or ask questions

# Design of the website

The website is designed as four separate pages to enable the user to easily and precisely locate the information they are looking for without scrolling through a lot of information.  

From each page, the user can navigate directly to the produce page as it is a priority that the user can easily and quickly access this information.

With the navigation links in the header and and back to top arrow featuring on each page users are easily able to navigate their journey through the website. The contact page features a form where the users can request to reserve an item for instore collection. 

The ethos of the business is natural, organic healthier food and this is reflected in the green and neutral minimalist colour scheme and design. The design is kept clean and simple.

As the business goal is primamrily to showcase the produce available in store the site primarily features images rather than text in order to attract the user towards the produce. 


## Wireframes

The initial wireframes from the design phase can be seen here. All design features were implemented.

[https://github.com/siobhanlgorman/Sourdough-Bakes/tree/master/wireframes]


## Fonts and Colour Scheme

The fonts chosen were Poppins, sans serif for the Headings and logo and Lora for the body. They were chosen for the rounded and cosy feel they inspire in the viewer in this designer's opinion. Charcoal #3a3a3a was chosen for the font colour as it is less harsh to the users' eyes than black. However it was replaced by black #252525 in the text boxes overlaying the green background for better contrast and visibility against the green and the image.

## Colours
    
The colour theme is based around the colour of the business logo which is a green color: #5b8030. The other green shades on the site and the other green shades used were chosen to tone with this and keep to the overall theme of natural colours. The colour scheme is by choice minimalist, bright and neutral in keeping with the overall ethos of the business (natural, clean, organic, healthier food). The background is neutral white to keep contrast high enough with the green. 




## Images

Images were dowloaded from Pixabay and resized for the purpose of this website. The owners are credited in the Credits section.
The Images are styled with curved borders which is modern and gives a softer effect.

# Languages

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) was used to design the basic website and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to style the website and make it look appealing to the user.


# Technologies Used

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframes.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) was used for the fonts: Poppins and Lora.

[Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com) was used for the social media icons, map link and the arrow back to top.

[Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps) was used to provide a map link.


# Testing

## Validation

* [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was run at several points during the project and any small errors identified were fixed. At the final stage no errors or warnings were found
* [CSS Validator]https://validator.w3.org/) was run several times during the project and syntax errors were corrected. At the time of submission the css code succesfully passed the validator with no errors.
* Lighthouse in Chrome Developer Tools was used to check performance and picked up some early contrast errors in colour choice so colours were adjusted accordingly. No other significant errors were found.

## Responsiveness

The website was tested on Chrome, Mozilla, Edge and Safari browsers with no problems found.
The website was tested on numerous sized screens including Iphones 8 and X, Moto G8 plus, 15" laptop, 24" screen and Ipad and was found to respond to all sizes.
Chrome development tools was used throughout the design process to check responsiveness and breakpoints and adjustments were made.

As a business owner I want to: 
* create an online presence for our business and grow our local customer base
* inform existing and new customers about our produce, location, opening hours
* to provide some introductory information on our USP which is authentic sourdough baked produce

These goals are achieved by the creation of a website with information about the business and the produce, clearly organised into relevant informative and separate pages.

This is achieved by the creation of a contact us form where users can submit their information and a message.

This story is satisfied by the 'back to top' arrow on the bottom right of each page
