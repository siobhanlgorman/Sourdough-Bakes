# UX

## Website Owner Business Goals
As the site owner of this bakery I want

* to deliver clear and easy to read information about my produce, the types offered and their price
* to encourage customers to visit the bakery to buy produce and offer them the opportunity to order and collect in store.
* to provide background information about why my produce is unique, healthy and good quality

## User Goals
As a user I want to

  * easily and intuitively navigate throughout the website
  * easily navigate between pages and return to home screen with one click
  * easily return to the navigation menu at the top of the page from the bottom of the page
  * be able to view the website and read all information on all screen sizes
  * view clear images throughout the site especially of the produce


## User Stories

### As a business owner
As the website and business owner I want to
  * create an online presence for our business
  * grow our local customer base
  * inform existing and new customers about our produce, location, opening hours
  * to provide a method of contact for customers to order produce or ask questions
  * to provide some introductory information on our USP which is authentic sourdough baked produce


### As a general user of the website/customer I want to 
* find out the location, opening hours and contact information 
* order some produce for collection
* find out more about sourdough
* view all the produce and relevant information about each item

### As a new user I want to

# Design of the website

The website is designed as four separate pages to enable the user to easily and precisely locate the information they are looking for without scrolling through a lot of information.  With the navigation links in the header and and back to top arrow featuring on each page users are easily able to navigate their journey through the website. The contact page features a form where the users can request to reserve an item for instore collection. The ethos of the business is natural, organic healthier food and this is reflected in the green and neutral minimalist colour scheme and design.

# Wireframes

## Fonts and Colour Scheme

The fonts chosen were Poppins, sans serif for the Headings and logo and Lora for the body. They were chosen for the rounded and cosy feel they inspire in the viewer in this designer's opinion. Charcoal #3a3a3a was chosen for the font colour as it is less harsh to the users' eyes than black. However it was replaced by black #252525 in the text boxes overlaying the green background for better contrast and visibility.

## Colours
    
The colour theme is based around the colour of the business logo which is a green color: #5b8030. The other green shades on the site and the other green shades used were chosen to tone with this and keep to the overall theme of natural colours. The colour scheme is by choice minimalist, bright and neutral in keeping with the overall ethos of the business (natural, clean, organic, healthier food). The background is neutral white to keep contrast high enough with the green.

    headings colour #252525 less harsh than black, also used for text on cover of hero image as #3a3a3a was a little too faint.
